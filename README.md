Quite a small project i worked on. I am learning rust as of the time writing and im not experienced there, neither i am on low-level languages. Just decided to build a tictactoe that can be played by more than 2 players and took about 3-4 hours while watching an hour or so tutorial. The language has a bit of a pleasing syntax but there are some quirks i hate tbh

It features:
- Play with more than two players at a time
- Color your symbols to differentiate them better 
- Highlighted blocks for the player that wins and all fainted pieces when it is a draw
- Dumb little random number generator(placeholder)
