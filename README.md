Quite a small project i worked on. I am learning rust as of the time writing and im not experienced there, neither i am on low-level languages. Just decided to build a tictactoe that can be played by more than 2 players and took about 3-4 hours while watching an hour or so tutorial. The language has a bit of a pleasing syntax but there are some quirks i hate tbh
